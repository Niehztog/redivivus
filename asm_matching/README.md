# asm_matching/ - measuring how faithful the reconstruction is

The tree builds and runs, but running proves little about any one function:
most code paths are never exercised, and a function can be wrong in a way that
does not crash. An ASM-matching oracle measures it directly. It recompiles the
reconstruction with the compiler that built the original and compares the
emitted code with the shipped `Game.exe`, function by function. A function
whose bytes match is the original code, provably; one that does not shows
where it differs.

| oracle | target | compiler | workspace |
|-|-|-|-|
| **msvc8** | `Game.exe` 1.14d (Windows) | Visual C++ 2005 SP1, under wine | [`msvc8/`](../asm_matching/msvc8/README.md) |

The method is the one three Quake II reconstructions use (the Gladiator bot
library, Rocket Arena 2 and OSP Tourney), whose VC6 and gcc 2.7.2.3 oracles
measured their trees function by function against the shipped DLLs. The
compiler was identified from the binary, not assumed:
[`msvc8/evidence/toolchain.md`](../asm_matching/msvc8/evidence/toolchain.md).

The live measurement is `msvc8/evidence/audit.tsv` and its `.summary`. Read
those; this file deliberately quotes no counts.

A second oracle would come from the Mac build of 1.14, which the project
README notes carries code the Windows executable does not: the same source
compiled by an entirely different compiler sees different things, as the
siblings' gcc oracles did for their Linux builds.
